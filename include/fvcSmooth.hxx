Description
	Provides functions smooth spread and sweep which use the FaceCellWave
	algorithm to smooth and redistribute the first field argument.

	smooth: smooths the field by ensuring the values in neighbouring cells are
			at least coeff* the cell value.

	spread: redistributes the field by spreading the maximum value within the
			region defined by the value (being between alphaMax and alphaMin)
			and gradient of alpha (where the difference between the values in
			neighbouring cells is larger than alphaDiff).

	sweep: redistributes the field by sweeping the maximum value where the
		   gradient of alpha is large (where the difference between the values
		   in neighbouring cells is larger than alphaDiff) away from that
		   starting point of the sweep.

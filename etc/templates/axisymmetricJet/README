Overview
========
+ Template case for axisymmetric jet flow
+ The main purpose of this template is to demonstrate a simple, reliable meshing
  strategy for axisymmetric flow

Meshing
=======
+ The blockMeshDict file contains a backgroundMesh subditionary
+ In backgroundMesh set the geometry radius and length and jet radius
+ Set the number of cells in the length and radial directions
+ Run blockMesh to generate a 2D "slab" mesh
+ Run extrudeMesh to convert the mesh into a 2D axisymmetric mesh with wedge
  front and back patches

Initialisation
==============
+ In the field files in the 0 directory, set inlet values
+ For example, in 0/U, set the inlet velocity Uinlet
+ Set the viscosity in constant/transportProperties

Output
======
+ Graph data of field values along the centreline are written to files in
  postProcessing/graph
